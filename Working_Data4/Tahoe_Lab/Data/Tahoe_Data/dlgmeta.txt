Metadata for Large-scale DLGs

Digital line graph (DLG) data are digital representations of cartographic information. DLG's of map features are converted to digital form from maps and related sources. Large-scale DLG data are derived from USGS 1:20,000-, 1:24,000-, and 1:25,000-scale topographic quadrangle maps. Large-scale DLG's are sold in nine categories: (1) hypsography, (2) hydrography, (3) vegetative surface cover, (4) non-vegetative features, (5) boundaries, (6) survey control and markers, (7) transportation; (8) manmade features, and (9) Public Land Survey System. All DLG data distributed by the USGS are DLG - Level 3 (DLG-3), which means the data contain a full range of attribute codes, have full topological structuring, and have passed certain quality-control checks. This is a data-set level implementation of the Federal Geographic Data Committee's Content Standards for Digital Geospatial Metadata.

Information about individual Large-scale DLG records can be obtained from the EROS Data Center.

  Description:
    Abstract:
      Digital line graph (DLG) data are digital representations
      of cartographic information. DLG's of map features are
      converted to digital form from maps and related sources.
      Large-scale DLG data are derived from USGS 1: 20,000-, 1:
      24,000-, and 1: 25,000-scale 7.5-minute topographic
      quadrangle maps. Large-scale DLG data are available in
      nine categories: (1) hypsography, (2) hydrography, (3)
      vegetative surface cover, (4) non-vegetative features,
      (5) boundaries, (6) survey control and markers, (7)
      transportation, (8) manmade features, (9) Public Land
      Survey System. All DLG data distributed by the USGS are
      DLG - Level 3 (DLG-3), which means the data contain a
      full range of attribute codes, have full topological
      structuring, and have passed certain quality-control
      checks.
    Purpose:
      DLG's depict information about geographic features on or near
      the surface of the Earth, terrain, and political and administrative
      units.  These data were collected as part of the National Mapping
      Program.

Data Quality Information


Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Unknown
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Topological requirements include: lines must begin and end at
    nodes, lines must connect to each other at nodes, lines do not
    extend through nodes, left and right areas are defined for each
    line element and are consistent throughout the file, and the
    lines representing the limits of the file (neatline) are free of
    gaps.

    The tests of logical consistency were performed by the USGS
    PROSYS program.  The neatline was generated by connecting the
    four corners of the digital file, as established during initialization
    of the digital file.  All data outside the enclosed region were ignored
    and all data crossing these geographically straight lines were clipped at
    the neatline. Data within a specified tolerance of the neatline
    were snapped to the neatline.  Neatline straightening aligned the
    digitized edges of the digital data with the generated neatline,
    that is, with the longitude/latitude lines in geographic
    coordinates.  All internal areas were tested for closure using
    PROSYS.
  Completeness_Report:
    For Digital Revision Status = Not revised
    Data completeness reflects the content of the source quadrangle.
    Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source
    graphic, due to scale and legibility constraints.

    For Digital Revision Status = Limited Update
    This file has undergone limited update digital revision.  The
    file contains only (1) those features that are photoidentifiable
    on monoscopic source, supplemented with limited ancillary source,
    and (2) those features, present on the original source quadrangle,
    that can not be reliably photoidentified but that are not
    considered particularly prone to change.

    For Digital Revision Status = Standard Update
    This file has undergone standard update digital revision. The
    data completeness of this file meets NMD standards for feature
    content.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        For Digital Revision Status = Not digitally revised:
        This Digital Line Graph was digitized from the USGS source
        quadrangle, by either the National Mapping Division, one of
        their cooperators, or one of their contractors.  The digital data
        were produced by one of the following methods:

        - scanning a stable-based copy of the graphic materials.
        The scanning process captured the digital data at a
        scanning resolution of at least 0.001 inches;  the
        resulting raster data were vectorized and then attributed
        on an interactive editing station.

        - scanning the paper map.  The scanning process captured
        the digital data at a scanning resolution of at least
        0.001 inches;  the resulting raster data were vectorized
        and then attributed on an interactive editing station.

        - scanning a stable-based copy of the graphic materials.
        The resulting raster data were then manually digitized
        and attributed on an interactive editing station.  The
        resolution of the digital data is at least 0.001 inches.

        - scanning the paper map.  The resulting raster data were
        then manually digitized and attributed on an interactive
        editing station.  The resolution of the digital data is
        at least 0.001 inches.

        - manually digitizing from a stable-based copy of the
        graphic material using a digitizing table to capture the
        digital data at a resolution of at least 0.001 inches;
        attribution was performed either as the data were
        digitized, or on an interactive edit station after the
        digitizing was completed.

        - manually digitizing from the paper map using a digitizing
        table to capture the digital data at a resolution of at
        least 0.001 inches;  attribution was performed either as
        the data were digitized, or on an interactive edit
        station after the digitizing was completed.

        The determination of the DLG production method was based on
        various criteria, including feature density, feature
        symbology, and availability of production systems.  Four
        control points corresponding to the four corners of the
        quadrangle were used for registration during data
        collection.  An eight parameter projective transformation
        was performed on the coordinates used in the data collection
        and editing systems to register the digital data to the
        internal coordinates used in PROSYS, and a four parameter linear
        transformation was performed from the PROSYS internal coordinates
        to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid coordinates.  The DLG
        data were checked for position by one or more of the following
        processes:
        - comparing plots of the digital data to the graphic source.
        - comparing the digital data to the digital raster scan.

        DLG data classification was checked by at least one of the
        following processes.
        - comparing plots of the digital data to the graphic source
        - comparing the digital data to the digital raster scan.

Entity and Attribute Information


Entity_and_Attribute_Information:
  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      DLG3 attribute codes are used to describe the physical and cultural
      characteristics of DLG node, line, and area elements. Attribute codes
      are used to reduce redundant information, provide enough reference
      information to support integration with larger data base, and describe
      the relationships between cartographic elements. Each DLG element
      has one or more attribute codes composed of a three digit major code
      and a four-digit minor code. For example, with the 1: 24,000-scale DLG
      data, the line attribute code 050 0412 has a major code (050), meaning
      hydrography, with a minor code (0412) meaning stream.

    Ordering_Instructions:
      All nonstandard quadrangles with neatlines that extend beyond the
      standard unit size to accommodate overedge boundaries are collected
      as multiples of the standard unit size. Data covering a 7.5- by 8.5-
      minute quadrangle area would be sold as two 7.5-minute units.
      Each 7.5-minute unit is distributed as 1 7.5-minute cell,  except in
      high-density areas, where the 7.5-minute cells may be divided into 2 or
      more cells.
      The transportation category of data includes major transportation systems
      collected in three separate overlays labeled: (1) Roads and Trails, (2) Railroads,
      and (3) Pipelines, Transmission Lines, and Miscellaneous Transportation Features.
      Although collected separately, the three files are distributed as a single unit.
      Orders for the transportation category for a given area will include all
      three files.

      Dataset searching and ordering capabilities are available through the
      Global Land Information System (GLIS) at:
